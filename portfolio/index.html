        <h2><em>Hobbies </em></h2>
        <p> I love coding of course. This is one of the reasons why I am doing this bootcamp. I love coding and want to build my skills.</p>
        <p> Spending time outside is great, but only if the weather is nice. Nice weather to me is  when the weather is betweeen 60&deg;s - 70&deg;s. I also prefer that it is not very humid outside. </p>
